# GameOn-Reddit
Android App that shows the top postings ofÂ /r/gaming on reddit. For each post it displays name, subreddit and score. I made use of the API endpoint: http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/top.json

Implemented "Infinite Scrolling" of the RecyclerView. The list adds 25 next entries every time the user reaches the bottom.
I also noted the networking state changes, rotations, screen sizes, etc.
